### About me

My learning path in programming started a year ago when I decided to quit my job as an English teacher and challenge myself to learn coding.

I am fully aware of the step I make to embrace the complexity of coding, yet I believe it will be a fun and rewarding journey.

### Code examples


Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. 

We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

```js
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
    
   return arrayOfSheep.reduce ((total, sheep) => total + (sheep ? 1 : 0))
}
```
